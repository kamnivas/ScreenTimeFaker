**THIS REPOSITORY IS OBSOLETE, DOESN'T WORK, AND ABANDONED**

~~This PWA (Progressive Web Application) is a WIP.~~

~~Ever since my 126th commit (very specific) I have added the ability to change your phone name!~~
~~The app is now usable for anyone (after it's finished, obviously)~~

~~DISCLAIMER: SOME FEATURES WILL BE INCOMPELTE!!!~~
~~If you would still like to try it, here are some steps:~~

~~============================== INSTALLATION ==============================~~
~~1. Click/copy and paste this link: https://kamnivas.github.io/ScreenTimeFaker~~
~~2. Add the webpage to home screen~~
    ~~If you do not already know how to do this, here you go (2 tutorials in 1!):~~
    ~~- Press share (rectangle with an arrow pointing up)~~
    ~~- Scroll down to find "Add to Home Screen"~~
    ~~- Give it a name like "Settings" if you'd like to confuse your parents, the icon is already the settings icon~~
~~3. If you kept the name as ScreenTimeFaker, you should probably hide it somewhere (optional but highly reccomended)~~

~~============================== USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ==============================~~
~~So far, you can change the following:~~
~~- Phone Name~~
~~- Daily Usage~~

~~========== HOW TO CHANGE DATA ==========~~
~~Triple-Click the secret button to access the Add/Edit Usage Page~~
~~- The secret button is exactly at the bottom where "Turn Off App and Website Activity is"~~
~~- You have 500 Miliseconds (half a second) to click it 3 times~~
~~- You will then be brought to the Settings page~~
~~- You can edit your usage here by clicking different days and the phone name (Apple iPhone by default)~~
~~- Usage is in minutes (eg. 60 means you used 1 hr)~~

~~========== THIS APP IS NOT STUPID PROOF ==========~~
~~Edit to your heart's desire, but there are a few things that I wouldn't reccomend doing~~
~~1. Negative minutes~~
    ~~- This will not result in a crash, but it will only result in it counting as 0, or nonexistent~~
    ~~- You're also wasting your time doing this~~
~~2. More than 24 hours~~
    ~~- Yes, also ok for memes, but that wasn't this app's intention~~
    ~~- This will also not result in a crash, but the bar will be extended very high up~~
~~3. Really long phone name~~
    ~~- Please keep the phone name to your name, and then iPhone, that would fit the best~~
    ~~- eg. Kamnivas's iPhone~~

~~==================== TROUBLESHOOTING ====================~~
~~I have run into a few issues myself. I will update this list with fixes as needed~~

~~1. Data is not saving~~
    ~~Make sure you have enough storage quota, you can do this by...~~
    ~~- Go to settings and find Safari~~
    ~~- Scroll all the way down to Advanced~~
    ~~- At the very top, click website data~~
    ~~- Swipe left to delete data for websites~~
    ~~- You can also scroll all the way down for the option to clear all website data~~
    ~~This worked for me, I think it's worth a shot, then I realized how much website data I had~~
~~2. App is not in fullscreen~~
    ~~Make sure you've done a few things:~~
    ~~- Add the app to your home screen - it won't work otherwise~~
    ~~- Use Google Chrome or Safari, both of these work, I cannot speak for other browsers~~
    ~~If it still doesn't work, I'm sorry but I don't know what the issue is~~
~~============================================================~~
~~I WILL UPDATE THIS README AS NEEDED~~

~~Feel free to DM me and thank me on Discord: kamnivas~~
~~(Please mention something about ScreenTimeFaker so that I know you didn't make a username typo)~~
