This PWA (Progressive Web Application) is a WIP.
Currently, it is tailored for my own use.
However I may make this more versatile in the future.

HOW TO INSTALL (Just in case)

1. Click/Copy and paste this link: https://kamnivas.github.io/ScreenTimeFaker.
Note: You MUST use Google Chrome. If you use Safari, you will not end up with fullscreen (I cannot speak for other browsers other than Safari).

2. Click "Share" (it should be next to the URL) and scroll down to find "Add to Home Screen".
Note: If you do not do this step, you will not get fullscreen. If you use Safari, you will not get fullscreen either way, so use Google Chrome.

3. There should be a shortcut on your homepage now, and if I were you, hide it somewhere! Now whenever you want to use it, just click the app!
Note: If fullscreen doesn't work and you used Google Chrome already, I'm sorry, but it worked for me, I don't know what's wrong.

When the app gets more advanced, I will add usage instructions. It is currently very simple and not usable.
The link is only for testing purposes.
